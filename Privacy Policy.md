# JUNO's Privacy Policy
## Introduction
This privacy policy was written for JUNO, a bot coded by @theorie on Discord with the intent to help players of ARK: Survival Ascended organize and streamline their tribe's breeding and claiming process. It was designed with a PVP megatribe environment in mind but is not limited to this use. Throughout this document, JUNO may be referred to as "the bot". This policy intends to clarify what data JUNO collects, how the data is used, and what your rights are to your data.
## What Information Does JUNO Store?
* Guild/Discord server IDs
* Channel IDs
* User IDs
* Role IDs
* Member IDs
* In-game dinosaur stat information voluntarily submitted to JUNO, which MAY include:
 * Base stats, mutations, mutation counts, stat values, etc.

Storing this data is essential to the functions JUNO offers, though some of these functions are voluntary. By using voluntary features such as the dinosaur database, you are consenting to share this information with the bot.
## What Information Is NOT Stored?
* Messages sent in any guild in any channel by any user.
* Transcripts for any thread ticket, which is delegated to your tribe's guild.
* Anything else not explicitly listed as above.
## Why Is This Data Necessary?
Due to JUNO's intended use, it is necessary to store this data to meet the promise of these functions.

* Guild IDs are stored for configuration settings - the primary intent is to keep all guilds and their data separate.
* Channel IDs are stored for configuration settings, including commands and thread ticket functions. 
* Role IDs are stored for configuration settings, including permissions checks, moderation, and thread ticket functions. 
* Member IDs are temporarily stored for ticket reminders, functions to temporarily add and remove a role from a user, and to identify which tribe member breeds what dinosaur - IF it is formatted in that way. This information is used only in the dinosaur database and the ticket system.

## Is My Data Shared With Any Third Parties?
No, none of the data that is stored via JUNO is shared with any third parties whatsoever. All information is confidential and available to your guild only.
## How Can I Have My Tribe's Data Deleted?
Users can request the removal of data associated with their guild by contacting @theorie via Discord. For security reasons, anyone requesting this must prove they are the owner of the tribe's guild. If JUNO is still present, it will be removed from the server to complete this request.
