## About JUNO
JUNO is a bot that was coded for players of ARK: Survival Ascended to help organize and streamline their tribe's breeding and claiming process. This bot was designed for use in a PVP megatribe environment but it is not limited to this use.

Features includes:

* A comprehensive database that saves your tribe's unique dinosaur information.
* An auto-complete function searches your tribe's database in real-time.
* Common sense permissions checks that respects tribe hierarchy.
* A ticket system using **private** threads for a cleaner look; and bigger tribes won't hit the channel cap with traditional, channel-based ticket bots.
* Temporarily disable claims for any dinosaur for any reason.
* An optional Gestation Events system where regular tickets might be a bit inconvenient.
* The ability to keep track of the number of female breeders your tribe has for each dinosaur and altogether for the tribe.
* The ability to keep track of mutation progress for your tribe.
* Transcript logging delegated to your tribe's discord server.
